  "description": "<p>Korosho is more than just a cashew company – we are a movement, dedicated to reshaping the global cashew industry while making a positive impact on the lives of farmers, communities, and consumers alike.   We pride ourselves on sourcing the finest cashews from Tanzania. Nestled in the Makonde Plateau, a region in southern Tanzania the tropical climate provides the perfect conditions for cashew cultivation. With temperatures ranging between 15 and 33 degrees Celsius year-round and an average annual rainfall of 1000mm, our cashews thrive without the need for additional irrigation, resulting in exceptionally large and delicious nuts.  The region is situated along the Indian Ocean just south of the equator and boasts natural wonders like Mount Kilimanjaro, Lake Victoria, and the renowned Serengeti National Park. Our company name, \"Korosho,\" derived from the Swahili word for cashew, pays homage to the rich cultural and linguistic tapestry of Tanzania.   Despite being the sixth-largest cashew-producing country globally, much of Tanzania's harvest is exported raw to Asia for processing, depriving the local economy of valuable opportunities and contributing unnecessary CO2 emissions. By leveraging local expertise and infrastructure, we streamline the supply chain, enabling us to transport our cashews directly to Europe without detours through Southeast Asia. This direct sea route reduces transportation time and carbon emissions, allowing us to deliver fresher products to our customers. On top of that, we arw committed to preserving and promoting the small-scale farming traditions of the Makonde region. For over a century, cashews have been a vital source of sustenance for local families, with each household typically owning at least one cashew tree. Rather than sourcing from large plantations, we directly engage with numerous farming families to procure our cashew harvest. Our approach emphasizes direct relationships with small-scale farmers, bypassing middlemen to ensure fair compensation for their labor. From harvesting to sorting, drying, and quality control, our cashews undergo meticulous processing overseen by local partners and women's organizations. Similarly, packaging, storage, and transportation are entrusted to local entrepreneurs, minimizing our environmental footprint and supporting local economies. As champions of constant innovation, we are committed to offering not only new and exciting snack varieties but also innovative vegan options. To minimize our ecological impact, all our products are processed and packaged in Germany, further reducing transportation distances and emissions. Our commitment to sustainability extends to our packaging, featuring the first 100% plastic-free paper packaging in the snack industry in Germany. After enjoying our delicious cashews, customers can simply dispose of the packaging in the recycling bin, where it can be fully recycled.</p>",

  "description": "<p>j'ai mal à la tête was founded in 2012 by Anja Pawlik and Roman Dorfner in Munich, Germany. With a phrase from his work „ e book of disquiet“ the Portuguese writer Fernando Pessoa provides the inspiration for the name of the men ́s label. “J´ai mal à la tête et à l´univers“ – Too much is crackling in, while nothing entangles. The focus on what stays seems to be more important than ever. Thus, Anja Pawlik and Roman Dorfner create autonomous fashion beyond medial imperatives or trendy randomness. In their collections they play with stereotypical male images, without neglecting the high standards men demand from their clothing. A sporty but yet elegant silhouette meets the need of postmodern individualists to dress masculinely and originally at the same time. The ideal of “J´ai mal à la tête”: To transform the swift zeitgeist into timeless pieces. This sustainability in creation lives on the sustainability in production.</p>",

During our college years, we realized that neither coffee nor energy drinks were the right choice for us to stay energized throughout the day. That's why we set out on a quest for a better alternative – and found it in Ecuador.</p><p></p><p><strong>A Fresh Alternative</strong></p><p>JUMA BETTER ENERGY FOR YOU is the result of our search for a healthy and invigorating option for your daily energy boost. Based on Guayusa, our products are not only delicious but also provide the same wake-up effect as coffee while being as gentle as tea.</p><p></p><p><strong>Direct Trade for Sustainability</strong></p><p>Our organic Guayusa comes directly from a self-managed farmer cooperative in Tenar, Ecuador. Through direct trade, we not only support the local community but also preserve biodiversity through sustainable cultivation in permaculture farms.</p><p></p><p><strong>1% for the Planet</strong></p><p>As a member of 1% for the Planet, we donate 1% of our annual revenue to environmental and biodiversity projects, primarily in the region where we source our Guayusa.

  "description": "Welcome to our Story, we are Mohamed and Kim.\n\nOur story begins with a journey, a journey that took us from different corners of the world and brought us together. Mohamed, born in Egypt, embarked on a new adventure when he moved to Germany a few years ago. That’s where he met Kim, who is originally from The Netherlands, and so it all began..\n\nIt was during our first trip to Egypt together that the seeds of our dream were planted. Experiencing the awe-inspiring beauty, rich heritage, and vibrant culture of Egypt left an indelible mark on our hearts.\n\nAnd so, Roya was born. Roya is an Arabic word that translates to dream or vision. It is a dream coming true sharing the magic of Egypt with you.\n\nOne of the core values that defines Roya is our deep appreciation for craftsmanship and the artistry of Egyptian artisans. We are privileged to collaborate with talented individuals who possess the skill and passion to create the most beautiful handmade treasures. By showcasing their exceptional work, we aim to preserve traditional craftsmanship and support local communities.\n\nWe are grateful for the opportunity to embark on this journey and share our love for Egypt with you. Whether you are seeking a meaningful gift, a touch of elegance for your home, or simply a piece of art that resonates with your soul, we invite you to explore the treasures of Roya. Join us in celebrating the beauty, culture, and craftsmanship that Egypt has to offer.",

  "description": "<p><strong>First developed over twenty years ago!</strong> Just chew the tablets and brush as usual. Or as we like to say, polish! Thanks to their 70% cellulose content, our tablets have a polishing effect that makes your teeth smoother. Combine them with our ultra-soft bamboo toothbrush to maximise this effect. Because we are water-free, we are free of potentially harmful ingredients.</p><p></p><h3>We see our tablets as a symbol of change and challenging established routines.</h3><h3></h3><p>In 1992, Axel Kaiser and his two brothers founded the dental laboratory proDentum in Berlin as a sales organisation for the parent laboratory in Singapore, which was initiated by his brother Christoph, to provide patients with high-quality and much more affordable dentures. At the end of the 1990s, Axel helped one of the dental customers with the practical part of his doctoral thesis. Topic: Development of an anhydrous toothpaste that would avoid many ingredients that were unnecessary for dental care but potentially critical for the body. After a few trials and a lot of research, a granulate was created. More out of curiosity than anything else, this was developed into a tablet, which was first sold in the autumn of 2003. Denttabs innovative Zahnpflegegesellschaft mbH, previously a proDentum project, was officially founded on 1 January 2009.</p><p></p><h3>Denttabs only uses natural ingredients.</h3><p></p><p>Did you know that toothpaste is still being sold which contains additives such as preservatives, germ inhibitors and stabilisers that are potentially problematic for the body and the environment?</p><p>Our toothpaste tablets consist exclusively of naturally certified ingredients that bear the Cosmos Natural seal of the BDHI.</p><p>They are anhydrous and can therefore do without unnecessary additives that are potentially critical for the body.</p><p>This not only protects the mucous membranes, but also keeps the waste water clean.</p><p>You can easily spit denttabs into the forest. You shouldn't do that with toothpaste!</p><p>Our tablets consist of 70% renewable cellulose. The cellulose fibres are obtained from woody plant parts and polish your teeth gently and ultra-smoothly right into the interdental spaces. As a result, new particles simply roll off the surface of your teeth. Plaque, also known as plaque, is practically prevented from forming in the first place.</p><p></p><h3>Denttabs - a sustainable project.</h3><p></p><p>Did you know that almost 500 million non-recyclable tubes of plastic are produced in Germany every year just from toothpaste and are simply incinerated?</p><p></p><p>Our Denttabs toothbrush tablets require approx. 80% less packaging than toothpaste and are packed in industrially compostable, bio-based bags. Less plastic and packaging with more content: one bag of toothbrush tablets is equivalent to two tubes of toothpaste.</p><p>The toothpaste tablets can also be used right up to the last tablet - up to 14% of toothpaste remains unused in the tube. Both the tablets and the packaging are lightweight and save considerably on weight and volume. This means less CO2 emissions during transport.</p><p></p><p>Of course, you can also find our toothpaste tablets in unpackaged shops: 100% zero waste.</p><p>We work for a future fit for grandchildren and are involved in numerous projects. <strong>Denttabs has been honoured with the German Sustainability Award 2021.</strong></p><p></p><h3>Denttabs- no foam needed</h3><p></p><p>Did you know that you can brush your teeth perfectly without foam?</p><p></p><p>We are convinced that foam belongs on beer or in the bath, but not in the mouth. We have deliberately opted for a gentle, plant-based surfactant (Amisoft or Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate). It ensures that proteins, fats and carbohydrates combine with water and are flushed out when rinsing.</p><p></p><p>According to studies, Denttabs has exactly the same cleaning performance as conventional toothpaste, which mainly contains aggressive surfactants. Although aggressive surfactants foam, they have the disadvantage that they irritate the mucous membranes and can reduce the fluoride-containing remineralisation effect.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Far removed from the usual art clichés, the art:ig gallery stands primarily for naughty, young and snotty-nosed art beyond the yawning mainstream. Not only are modern paintings by up-and-coming artists sold here in limited and open editions, but they are also refined and individualized until the treated art print voluntarily falls out of the frame with joy. The basis for this is a diverse selection of paintings, photos and collages from the fields of pop art, black and white photography, street art, comics and skateboard surf design, which are printed on MDF boards using a special finishing technique, giving them an almost surgical facelift with a completely new face, but without any stitches behind the ears. Just as unique is the personalization and embellishment of pictures brought in by the customer, such as wedding photos, portraits or duckface selfies, which, in a 7-14 day processing time, go beyond the bounds of normality and boredom and, to the delight of the customer, leave the gallery as an artistic one-off for the living room wall. The fact that the maxim of the two competent gallery owners, Tommi Hallmann and Chryssi Tsiaoussi, is to embellish existing art so artistically that it becomes priceless unique pieces at affordable prices, is more than proven by the fact alone that this small but fine store has been able to survive for so long in the thicket of Munich's artificial gallery culture about Hundertwasser.</p>",

The maesh bags are made from 90% upcycled materials and are produced in Hanover in a resource-saving manner. Craftsmanship combined with a sense of aesthetics and design turn used advertising banners into a unique, functional and robust bag design. Each bag is unique.</p><p></p><h3>Local&nbsp;</h3><p>The entire production of maesh bags is carried out at the Hanover-Nordstadt site. Product development, prototype production and final production - all this happens \"UNDER ONE ROOF\". One of our maesh missions is to give advertising banners throughout Germany a second chance and to design beautiful new bags from them.&nbsp;</p><p></p><h3>Social</h3><p>Creating jobs for talented women with a history of migration or flight is our top priority. maesh is a product of this work philosophy and is not profit-oriented. All proceeds are used to maintain and expand the company and make a sustainable contribution to the common good and to strengthening Hanover as a production location.</p>",

We are Limbo Essentials!</strong></h3><p></p><p>Limbo is a brand born from love and passion for healthy living, respect for the planet, and taking maximum care of our body and our environment.</p><p></p><p><strong>“Mens sana in corpore sana”</strong> the balance between the spirit, mind and body in the best conditions and in the best balance.</p><p>This essence is what the two founders of this concept, Africa and Marina, share. Two engineers who, in the midst of our busy professional lives, had a vision.</p><p></p><p><strong>Healthy living and sports need a healthy energy drink.</strong></p><p></p><p>There are many energy drinks associated with enhancing energy, performance, strength or recovery for sports, but we envision a natural drink, capable of providing both these activating values, as well as relaxation properties, spiritual balance, rejuvenation and toning.</p><p>We find <strong>the ideal formula</strong> in the oldest drinks of traditional Japanese society. In the tea leaf, and specifically in macha tea, whose natural origin is green tea. The origin of tea is said to date back to 2737 BC when Emperor Shen Nong accidentally discovered it. Now, more than 4000 years later, our vision is fulfilled, with a perfect combination of a macha tea selected directly from a small town in Japan, enhancing its flavor and properties with excellent food supplements.</p><p>We are very proud to be able to offer you the result of our research, many hours of development, work and obsessive search for the best natural and healthy product. Our <strong>matcha tea with food supplements</strong> that we named Limbo Essentials.</p><p>We created Limbo Essentials with the purpose of spreading <strong>positive energy focused on well-being.</strong> We are passionate about challenging ourselves and exceeding our limits day after day, living the adventure with intensity, connecting with nature and enjoying the small moments with our friends to the fullest.</p><p>From the Limbo Essentials team, we want to take our passions to a higher level, and we would love for <strong>YOU</strong> to be part of it by accompanying us on this path.</p>",

Our goal: developing a personal care product that is as low packaging as a solid product, but at the same time offers the familiar convenience of a liquid product. For a sustainable bathroom, less carbon emissions and packaging waste - and yet without compromise.</p><p></p><p>We quickly realized that it was not enough to develop a water-free product, but that personal care products had to be completely rethought. After all, it is quite frightening what we put on our bodies, hair, hands and faces every day: aggressive surfactants, carcinogenic preservatives and microplastics are unfortunately still found in far too many products. We did not want that to be the case! </p><p></p><p>And, we have succeeded: 100% well thought-out and carefully selected ingredients and 0% marketing bla bla. Made in Germany, cruelty-free, vegan, biodegradable and without sulphates and other aggressive ingredients.</p><p></p><p>Let's change how we wash tomorrow together and not only make our world a little better every day, but drive the all-important change in the personal care industry - we can't wait!</p>",

  "description": "Since 2008, we have ventured into remote rainforests to source the world’s rarest & fairest cacao beans and transform the cultures of chocolate, food and luxury. Today, we lead Europe's craft chocolate movement as a pioneer for regenerative business practices.\n\nThat may sound like a not-so-humble humblebrag. But we’re miles away from our larger goal of creating a food  culture that regenerates our world. In the meantime we promise that our chocolate will be the most delicious experience you’ll have fighting for the environment, its caretakers and inhabitants.\n\nOur story of marrying chocolate and conservation may seem complicated but it’s actually quite simple. We make some of the world’s best chocolate from the rarest & fairest cacao beans around, and preserve these beans and their forest environments for future chocolate lovers. We’ve won all the major taste awards, are a favourite of top chefs, and have streamlined every aspect of our business to be people and planet positive.\n\nOn our own we grow a regenerative business. Together, let's regenerate what we consume. Together 100% regenerative.",

Natural materials have long been cherished in the fashion world for their inherent beauty, comfort, and sustainability. Finally, making sure that the garment has a comfortable fit that is easy to move in and flattering is important to ensure that customers have the most positive experience wearing MIA &amp; SOLE.</p><p></p><h3>We, the Founders</h3><p></p><p>MIA &amp; SOLE was founded in 2023 by Sophia Brandis and Marlene Engel and is based in Berlin. “We must focus on eliminating rushed production processes and commit to using only high-quality materials, labor practices, and product standards. We want to focus on understanding the customer's needs and expectations. Ultimately, we want to create garments that are made to last.”</p><p></p><h3>How it works</h3><p></p><p>The fit of the clothes should depend on the individual wearing them. Every person has a different body shape and size, and may need clothes to be tailored to fit them perfectly. The pull strings and special tying techniques are designed to let you quickly and easily adjust the fit of the clothing so that it is comfortable regardless of whether you are wearing a size small, medium, or large. Simply pull or release the strings in the designated areas for a more customized fit.</p><p></p><h3>Sustainability</h3><p></p><p>For our products we are exclusively using natural fabrics, mostly produced in Italy. All of the materials are sourced from Europe. Each piece of clothing is meticulously crafted in Europe. Our chosen manufacturing partners are situated in Poland, Portugal and Lithuania. Only a limited number of pieces are produced to set an example against the overproduction in the fashion industry. Sustainability Materials that we use: Tencel, Organic Cotton, Cotton, Merino Fine Wool, Wool, Cashmere, Silk, Viscose, Cupro The knitting yarns are following the 4 sustainability framework: 4sustainability® is an innovative implementation framework and a registered trademark assuring the sustainability performances of fashion &amp; luxury supply chain. The hangtags are made of uncoated paper, 80% recycled material and 20% pure E.C.F fiber. Both are FSC certified. The product is completely biodegradable and recyclable.

Due to our diverse academic backgrounds in Architecture, Mathematics and Politics, it seemed as an obvious next step to collaborate and choose a secure job path, which meant opening a café in the midst of a pandemic.</p><p>Through our Specialty Coffee tour throughout Europe, and having worked at local specialty coffee shops in Munich, it became apparent to us that we would want to take part in the transformation of the Italian influenced coffee scene in Munich.</p><p>The initial idea consisted of sourcing 100%&nbsp;arabica beans, either directly or from trustworthy partners, in order to share the third wave experience with you. „Third Wave“ is the new coffee revolution, which not only aims at re-thinking coffee as a luxury product, but to extract and experience coffee with all its flavors, which none of the supermarket and capsule coffee products could achieve.</p><p>Have you ever wondered about our name and how we came up with Suuapinga? One of the oldest neighborhoods in Munich is Schwabing. Initially mentioned in the year 782 as Suuapinga, it’s actually older than the city Munich itself.</p>",

  "description": "<p>RAIIZ, inspired by the Spanish word \"raíz,\" meaning \"root,\" symbolizes where we come from and where we find our sense of belonging. It’s about feeling at home, no matter where we are.</p><p></p><p><strong>My Story</strong></p><p></p><p>I’m Paula García de Salazar, an architect and designer originally from Spain. Since 2012, Munich has been my second home, where I live with my small family and pursue my passion for design. My journey began with studying architecture in Madrid and Milan, but my love for working with my hands led me to discover woodworking. I became fascinated by creating functional art – objects that not only serve a purpose but also reflect beauty and my personal touch. I love helping others achieve the same in their own spaces.</p><p>For me, design is a playful, creative process. I combine materials, textures, colors, and forms until everything harmonizes and interacts with the surrounding space. Out of my roots, architectural background, and passion for art, RAIIZ was born. Every piece I create, whether a lamp or a mirror, is a reflection of my journey – and of yours.</p><p></p><p><strong>What We Do</strong></p><p></p><p>At RAIIZ, we design and handcraft unique, customizable lamps and mirrors. Each object is not just functional and beautiful but also a true reflection of individuality and personality.</p><p>Let RAIIZ bring a touch of artistry and warmth to your home.</p>",

As a shy teen who struggled with his body image, fitness helped transform my life, but balancing it with a busy schedule became harder over time. That’s when I envisioned a sportswear brand that makes staying active easier, with no compromises. In 2019, I took the leap and founded portance to help others experience the same positive change.</p><p></p><p><strong>Sustainability First</strong></p><p></p><p>Our designs use organic cotton from Turkey and India, and recycled polyester made from old PET bottles. Thanks to advanced FUZE™ technology, our garments stay fresh longer, reducing the need for frequent washing. Even the smallest details—labels, zippers, and packaging—are made from recycled materials.</p><p></p><p><strong>Made in Europe</strong></p><p></p><p>Every portance product is hand-stitched in a family-run factory in Poland, ensuring ethical production and fair wages. We’re proud of our transparent supply chain and close relationships with all our partners, creating sportswear that’s smarter, cleaner, and more sustainable for the future.</p>",

  "description": "<p>At Blue Farm, we believe in creating plant-based products that are good for you and the planet. On average, our customers purchase the equivalent of 10 liters of oat drink in powder form, saving 10 beverage cartons with each purchase. Our powder weighs 9 times less than packaged oat drinks, significantly reducing transport emissions by replacing truck deliveries with water straight from your tap.</p><p></p><p><strong>Sustainable Packaging</strong></p><p></p><p>Yes, our packaging is plastic. After extensive research, we found that monoplastic is currently the most sustainable option in Europe, as it can be 100% recycled. While compostable packaging may seem eco-friendly, it isn’t yet processed in urban waste facilities and often ends up incinerated.</p><p></p><p><strong>Reducing CO2</strong></p><p></p><p>Even though our oat drink powder requires drying, it still achieves a significantly lower carbon footprint—up to 1/3 less than packaged oat drinks and more than 2/3 less than cow’s milk.</p><p>Founded in Berlin in 2020 by Phil and Katia, Blue Farm is part of a movement that thinks ahead. We’re rethinking plant-based milk to make it not just an alternative, but an optimized, sustainable, and nutritious choice. Our mission? Power to the plant! With a team of 10, we aim to inspire a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle, while offering a creamy, delicious experience with natural ingredients. Everyone is welcome at the farm!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Founded in 2023 by designer Viviane Gehring, VI[NTA]GE is a young fashion label that gives pre-loved, secondhand clothing a second life through creative redesign. Each piece we create is a unique work of art, blending sustainability with style. We believe every garment has a story, and it deserves to be continued. For us, sustainability isn’t just a trend – it’s the foundation of everything we do. Every item that leaves our atelier is handcrafted with love, using resource-efficient and fair production methods.</p><p></p><p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p><p></p><p>More than 80% of clothing in the EU is thrown away. In consumer-driven societies, most used garments end up in landfills or incinerators, contributing to millions of tons of textile waste globally. At VI[NTA]GE, we aim to combat this issue by focusing on longevity and mindful consumption. Our mission is to move away from fast fashion and instead create timeless, stylish clothing that minimizes harm to our planet. We’re committed to making the fashion world more sustainable and individual—one unique piece at a time.</p><p>We’d love for you to join us on this journey.&nbsp;<strong>We love Preloved!</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>Founded in 2021, Seijo is an independent design studio focused on creating aesthetic and functional objects that go beyond the ordinary. We don’t follow trends or conventions. Instead, we trust our instincts and work on what we believe is truly valuable and necessary. Seijo objects blend traditional craftsmanship with modern techniques, using high-quality materials to create long-lasting designs. We are committed to responsible production, working closely with local artisans and responsible manufacturers across Germany and Europe.</p><p></p><p><strong>Our Materials</strong></p><p></p><p>We carefully select materials that bring both beauty and function. For example, our shadow gap frames are handcrafted from&nbsp;<strong>MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard)</strong>—a strong and smooth engineered wood that allows for precise crafting and a clean finish. Treated with natural wood oil, these frames not only look refined but are built to last. Another key material is layered cork, chosen for both its aesthetic appeal and functional benefits.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, our Seijo muslin towels are made from 100% certified organic cotton, crafted in Germany using GOTS-certified, triple-layered fabric. These towels are absorbent, quick-drying, and bring a touch of simple elegance to your spa routine.</p><p></p><p><strong>Why Seijo?</strong></p><p></p><p>The name \"Seijo\" (正常) comes from the Japanese word for \"normal.\" But Seijo objects are anything but ordinary. They challenge everyday norms by adding aesthetic value and functionality, fitting seamlessly into any space. We believe that even the simplest items deserve to be reimagined and brought to life with quality materials and thoughtful design. Seijo is more than just normal—it's a new standard of beauty and purpose.</p>",

For us, Persian rugs have always been more than just decor—they are pieces of art, tradition, and storytelling. Growing up surrounded by the beauty and history of these rugs, we eventually embraced our family heritage to bring these unique pieces to a modern audience.</p><p></p><p>Our online shop offers handpicked, handcrafted rugs and Kelim sourced directly from Iran. Each rug is a one-of-a-kind creation, made from natural materials like wool and cotton, and reflects centuries-old craftsmanship. Whether you're looking for colorful Kelim from the Gashgai nomads or finely woven pieces from Nain and Isfahan, we ensure quality, authenticity, and fair pricing.</p><p></p><p>At Rugtales, we believe these rugs deserve recognition from a new generation. Our mission is to reintroduce the charm and craftsmanship of Persian rugs, moving beyond the “grandmother’s rug” stereotype.
